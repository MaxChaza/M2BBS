The net properties dialogue shows all analysis results obtained so far.
</p>

<p>
To get a short property description, move the mouse pointer on the property name, do not move the mouse and you will see a tooltip.
</p>

<p>
The arrows below the properties allow you to switch between the result sets of each analysis step. The last result set in this list subsumes all previous results.</p>

<p>
The output button shows the output that was generated by the analysis and belongs to the displayed result set.
</p>

<p>
If a property is set, the value of the property determines the background color (true=green, false=red).
</p>

<p>
Sometimes results can be deduced from other results. Charlie implements a set of such rules. If all preconditions of a rule are fulfilled and the postconditions (the new results) are not already set, then the rule will be applied. The application of a rule will be notified.
