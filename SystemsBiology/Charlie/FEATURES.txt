features
--------

supported nets types
--------------------
qualitative extended place transition nets
Reaction - nets,Duration -nets

structural properties
---------------------
invariant computation
dependent set computation
deadlock/trap property


state space based analysis
--------------------------
reachability / coverability graph contruction and visualisation
and related anylysis
stubborn set reduction

CTL and LTL modelchecking

path analysis
shortes path computation for qual. and time nets
longest path computation for time nets

projects in progress and finshed
--------------------------------
1 
an abstract algorithmn for DFS and Tarjan's alg.
(thomas grundmann - praktikum - must be merged into the current version) 

2
analysis of nets with time information
(Ansgar Fischer - diploma thesis - finished)

3
a better user interface and multi threading support -- intensive refactoring 
(Andreas Franzke - diploma thesis - finished)
- multithreaded analyzer concept 
- textual user inferface
- rool based result management
4
improving invariant computation
(Matthias Kr√ºger - praktikum -in progress ?)


open tasks
----------
- review of the result management 
- import of paths as marking and transition sequences


wish list
---------
- RG export to snoopy
- witnesses and counter examples for CTL
- stubborn set reduction for LTL MC
- "Rang theorem"
- reduced CG with Finkels alg.
