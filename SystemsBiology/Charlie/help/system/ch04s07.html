			<p>
				The dialog net properties is not an analyzer itself but shows the properties of the net that already have been analyzed.
			</p>
			<p>
				If a property has not yet been analyzed and it has not been found by a rule it has a gray background.
				Properties that either have been analyzed or been implied by a rule have either a red, green or yellow background depending on the status.
				A green background always implies that the Petri net has the specific property, while a red background implies that the Petri net does not have the specific property.
				If the background is yellow then an analyzer found additional information for this property.
				Examples for this are the netclass or the k-boundedness.
				Those colors can also change from green/red to yellow, but they will never change from red to green or vice versa.
			</p>
			<p>
				Furthermore one can go through the different results that either an analyzer or a rule provided.
				The last result set always contains a summary of all results gained so far.
			</p>
			<p>
				With the button output, one can open the output dialog.
				In the output dialog the analyzers print out some additional information.
			</p>
			<p>
				Finally one can get some additional information, by pressing the help button, about the rule set that is stored in the system.
				The rules that are listed in the rule set can be applied to the results that are either gained by an analyzer or by another rule.
