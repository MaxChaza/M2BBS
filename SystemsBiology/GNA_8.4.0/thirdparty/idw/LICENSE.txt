    2. License Grants

   1. You may copy and distribute the Work together with a product if

      example, if developer A has developed software that uses the Work,
      and developer B has developed a product part that uses A's
      software, both A and B need to have purchased a developer license
      for the Work.

      (http://proguard.sourceforge.net) to obfuscate the Work together
      with a product that uses the Work. No support is provided by NNL
      for the obfuscated result.

   2. You may not transfer the grants of this license to anyone. The
      grants apply to you and noone else.

   3. You may not grant any rights, including distribution rights, for
      the Work or any part of the Work to anyone.
