 (TOGETHER WITH ITS ACCOMPANYING DOCUMENTATION, THE "PRODUCT") IS THE
 PROPERTY OF JPRODUCTIVITY, L.L.C. ("jProductivity"). THE PRODUCT IS
 MADE AVAILABLE TO YOU, THE ORIGINAL PURCHASER, SUBJECT TO THE FOLLOWING
 LICENSE AGREEMENT ("LICENSE"). PLEASE READ THIS LICENSE CAREFULLY
 BEFORE INSTALLING OR USING THE PRODUCT. A COPY OF THIS LICENSE IS
 AVAILABLE FOR YOUR FUTURE REFERENCE IN THE "LICENSE.HTML" FILE PROVIDED
 WITH THE PRODUCT.</strong></p>
<p><strong>IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THIS LICENSE, THEN YOU MAY
 NOT INSTALL OR USE THE PRODUCT. ANY USE BY YOU OF THIS PRODUCT ALSO
 CONSTITUTES YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THESE TERMS.</strong></p>
<p><strong> jProductivity is only willing to grant you this License if
 you obtained the Product from jProductivity or a jProductivity
 authorized reseller. If you obtained the Product from any other source
 you may not install or use the Product.</strong></p>
<p> <strong>1. Ownership.</strong> The Product is proprietary to
 jProductivity. The Product is licensed, not sold, to you
 notwithstanding any reference herein to "purchases." You acknowledge
 and agree that: (a) the Product is protected under U.S. copyright and
 other laws; (b) jProductivity and its licensors retain all copyrights

 Product. You have no rights hereunder to use any trademark or service
 mark belonging to jProductivity.</p>
<p><strong> 2. GRANT OF LICENSE AND SCOPE OF USE.</strong></p>
<p> <strong>2.1 Licenses.</strong> For each license that you acquire
 to use the Product, you will be provided with a License Certificate (a
 "License Certificate"), which may be either a certificate, the
 installation and licensing instructions, your invoice, or an activation
 file and which may be provided to you either with the Product media or
 separately by jProductivity or its authorized distributors or
 resellers. The License Certificate will contain information specific to
 the edition of the Product that you have licensed, the type of license
 under which you may use the Product and the number of licenses that you
 have acquired. In order to activate and use the Product as set forth in
 this License Agreement, you must follow the instructions when prompted
 by the Product or provided to you either with the Product media or
 separately by jProductivity or its authorized distributors or
 resellers. The types of licenses you may acquire are an Evaluation
 License and a Named User License, all defined in this Section 2 of this
 License Agreement. Unless your License Certificate identifies your
 acquisition of another license type, you have acquired a Named User
 License. For more information on which license types, if any, should be
 included with the Product media you should contact jProductivity or
 your jProductivity authorized distributor or reseller.</p>
<p> <strong>2.2 Evaluation License</strong>. The terms of this Section
 2.2 are applicable to you only if you have acquired an Evaluation
 License, as defined below, for the Product directly from jProductivity
 or a jProductivity authorized distributor or reseller. In order to
 evaluate the Product, you may install the Product, as outlined below,
 on a temporary basis for trial, evaluation, non-commercial purposes
 only (the "Evaluation Period"). The Evaluation Period is limited to the
 greater of the period of time specified to you by jProductivity or
 fifteen (15) days from the date the Product is installed. At the end of
 the Evaluation Period your license to use the Product expires. During
 the Evaluation Period, jProductivity grants you the personal,
 nonexclusive, nontransferable and limited license to use the Product
 solely for evaluation purposes. <strong>THE PRODUCT CONTAINS A
 TIME-OUT FEATURE THAT DISABLES ITS OPERATION AFTER THE EXPIRATION OF
 THE EVALUATION PERIOD. APPLICATIONS THAT YOU CREATE DURING THE
 EVALUATION PERIOD MAY REQUIRE THE PRODUCT IN ORDER TO RUN. UPON
 EXPIRATION OF THE EVALUATION PERIOD, THOSE APPLICATIONS MAY NO LONGER
 RUN. YOU SHOULD THEREFORE TAKE PRECAUTIONS TO AVOID ANY LOSS OF DATA
 THAT MIGHT RESULT</strong>. In order to use the Product after the
 Evaluation Period, you must obtain from jProductivity, or its
 authorized distributors or resellers a License Certificate outlining
 the number and type of grants of a license to use the Product in
 accordance with the terms and conditions of this License Agreement. You
 may not use the Product during the Evaluation Period for any
 commercial, business, governmental or institutional purpose of any
 kind. At the end of the Evaluation Period, further use of the Product
 by you is prohibited without the purchase of a commercial license to
 obtain a License Certificate. If you do not purchase a license for the
 Product at the end of the Evaluation Period, you hereby agree to
 permanently remove or delete the Product from all computer systems,
 including Servers, as defined below, and workstations, on which it was
 installed and destroy any software and documentation received, and not
 to reinstall the Product. If you desire to continue to use the Product
 following the Evaluation Period, you should contact jProductivity or a
 jProductivity authorized distributor or reseller to order commercial
 licenses to use the Product.</p>
<p> <strong>2.3 Named User Grant of License.</strong> The terms of
 this Section 2.3 are applicable to you only if you have acquired a
 Named User License, as defined below, for the Product directly from
 jProductivity or a jProductivity authorized distributor or reseller.
 Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, jProductivity
 grants to you, if you are an individual, or, if you are an entity, one
 (1) designated person in your organization ("Named User") a personal,
 nonexclusive, nontransferable and limited license to use the Product
 solely for your own internal purposes. You may purchase from
 jProductivity or a jProductivity authorized distributor or reseller
 additional licenses to permit multiple Named Users to use the Product
 (each, a "Named User License"). The foregoing Named User Licenses shall
 be for access and use, only by the equivalent number of Named Users for
 whom you have paid the applicable license fees and obtained a License
 Certificate. The Product may be used exclusively by the specifically
 designated Named Users, subject to all the terms and conditions of this
 License Agreement. You agree that you will not designate more Named
 Users than the number of Named User Licenses that jProductivity or a
 jProductivity authorized distributor or reseller has expressly granted
 to you and you will not allow the Product to be used by any individuals
 other than the Named Users designated by you from time to time. You may
 install the Product on a reasonable number of machines provided that
 the Named User is the only individual permitted to use the Product.
 Subject to the other terms and conditions of this License, you may make
 a reasonable number of copies of the Product to backup devices such as
 hard disks, optical media, or tape and one (1) physical CD media backup
 copy of the Product solely to replace the original copy provided to you
 if the original copy is damaged or destroyed. All rights not
 specifically granted to you herein are retained by jProductivity.</p>
 <p><strong>2.4 Deployment License.  </strong>
 The terms of this Section 2.4 are applicable to you only if you have purchased
 a Deployment License for the Product directly from jProductivity or a jProductivity 
 authorized distributor or reseller. Deployment Licenses are granted subject to certain 
 limitations and usage parameters specific to the type of Deployment License you have 
 acquired from jProductivity. Your invoice will show the number of Deployment Licenses, 
 by license type, for the Product you have acquired from jProductivity and will list 
 the usage parameters for each Deployment License. jProductivity currently offers 
 the types of Deployment Licenses for the Product listed below. jProductivity may, 
 at its sole discretion, elect to cease offering the below described Deployment 
 Licenses and replace them with different licensing models for deployment. In the 
 event you distribute the Product as contained within your Work(s) to end users of 
 your Work(s) you must purchase a separate license for each such end user from 
 jProductivity. In such event you must comply with the terms and conditions of 
 Section 3 below. <br>
 <br>
 (a) BACKEND (SERVER/CPU) DEPLOYMENT LICENSE: When you purchase a Backend (Server/CPU) 
 Deployment License with respect to a particular Product, jProductivity grants you a 
 personal, nonexclusive, nontransferable and limited license to install and execute 
 the Product on one (1) computer ("Server") solely for your own internal data processing 
 purposes to provide a limited number of support connections. You may not, under an 
 Server License, install or execute the Product on more than one (1) computer. The 
 total number of Product copies used by you and the manner in which such copies are 
 used may not exceed or deviate from the type and number of licenses acquired by you 
 and the usage parameters indicated on your invoice (i.e, type of platform and number 
 of CPUs, or number of Concurrent Users). If you would like to install and/or deploy 
 a greater number of copies of the Product than the number of Deployment Licenses you 
 have acquired from jProductivity or if you would like to alter the type or usage 
 parameters of any Deployment License you have acquired from jProductivity, you must 
 first contact jProductivity to obtain written approval and pricing for any such 
 modifications to your license.
 All rights not specifically granted to you herein are retained by jProductivity.
 </p>
 <p><strong>2.5 Competitive Product Restrictions. </strong>
 You may not include the Product or any component thereof, including any Redistributables 
 (as defined in Section 3) in any general-purpose software, library, 
 component, or any other product that is generally competitive with or a substitute for 
 the Product or any other jProductivity product offerings; nor may you use the Product 
 to create a product or operate a service that is generally competitive with the Product 
 or any other jProductivity product offerings, including any general-purpose software. The foregoing restriction does not apply, however, to your use of the 
 Product to develop "plug-ins" (i.e., integrations created using the Product's API) so 
 long as such plug-ins are designed to provide supplementary functionality to the Product.
 
 <p><strong> 3. GENERAL TERMS THAT APPLY TO COMPILED PROGRAMS AND REDISTRIBUTABLES.</strong></p>
<p> <strong>3.1 Redistributables</strong>. The Product may include
 certain files, libraries and/or source code specifically designated as
 "redistributables" by jProductivity in the accompanying printed or
 on-line documentation and that are necessary to use Works created using
 the Product ("Redistributables"). From time to time, jProductivity may
 designate other files as Redistributables. You should refer to the
 documentation, including any "readme" or "deploy" files provided with
 the Product, for additional information regarding Redistributables.
 Subject to the terms and conditions of this License and the license
 grant in Section 3.2, you may freely redistribute source code or
 compiled code that is entirely your own and does not contain any
 Redistributables.</p>
<p> <strong>3.2 Licensing of Redistributables.</strong> Subject to the
 terms and conditions of this License including the restrictions of
 Section 3.3, jProductivity grants you the personal, non-exclusive,
 non-transferable and limited license to: (a) make exact copies of the
 Redistributables and distribute those copies solely as components of
 your Works and solely as required for permitting end users of the Works
 ("End Users") to install and execute the Works; (b) install and execute
 Redistributables, without modification, on computers that you own or
 possess solely for your own internal use; and (c) sublicense to your
 End Users the personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable right to
 install and execute Redistributables, without modification, solely as
 components of Works and solely for such End Users' own internal use,
 subject to End Users' compliance with the restrictions in Section 5 as
 to Redistributables. The rights granted to you under this Section 3.2
 may not be exercised by others, including co-developers, regardless of
 how you might compile, link, or package your Works. These rights apply
 only to Redistributables and to no other file, library, source code or
 other component or derivative work of the Product. They may be
 exercised only with respect to Works created by you using a duly
 licensed, properly registered copy of the Product.</p>
<p> <strong>3.3 Certain Restrictions.</strong> Regardless of any
 modifications that you make and regardless of how you might compile,
 link, or package your Works: (a) you may not permit your End Users to
 modify, distribute or use Redistributables in any program that such End
 User creates, has created or uses other than the Works; (b) you may not
 use jProductivity 's or any of its suppliers' names, logos, or
 trademarks to market your Works, except to state descriptively that
 your Work was written using the Product; (c) all copies of the Works
 you create must bear a valid copyright notice, either your own or the
 jProductivity copyright notice that appears on the Product, and you may
 not remove or alter any jProductivity or its licensor's copyright,
 trademark or other proprietary rights notice contained in any portion
 of the Redistributables; and (d) you may only distribute
 Redistributables with Works that add primary and substantial
 functionality to the Redistributables, that are not merely a set or
 subset of any of the Redistributables, and that are created in
 accordance with the terms of this License.</p>
<p> <strong>3.4 Relationship with End Users.</strong> Except as set
 forth in Section 4, there are no third party beneficiaries to this
 License. Consequently, jProductivity provides no warranty at all to any
 person, other than the limited warranty provided to you the original
 purchaser of the Product, as set forth herein, and you will be solely
 responsible to your End Users (or anyone else who uses or acquires
 Works) for support, service, upgrades, or technical or other assistance
 (including with respect to any Redistributables included therein), and
 such persons will have no right to contact jProductivity for any
 services or assistance. You will indemnify, defend and hold
 jProductivity, its licensors, its suppliers and each of their
 respective employees, officers, directors and affiliates, harmless from
 and against any claims or liabilities arising out of or related to the
 use, procurement, reproduction or distribution of your Works by third
 parties.</p>
<p> <strong>3.5 Third Party Software.</strong> The Product, including
 Redistributables, may include source code, redistributable files,
 and/or other files provided by a third party vendor ("Third Party
 Product"). Since use of Third Party Product might be subject to license
 restrictions imposed by the third party vendor, you should refer to the
 on-line documentation (if any) provided with Third Party Product for
 any license restrictions imposed by the third party vendor. In any
 event, any license restrictions imposed by a third party vendor are in
 addition to, not in lieu of, the terms and conditions of this License.</p>
<p> <strong>3.6 Other Rights.</strong> Contact jProductivity for the
 applicable royalties due and other licensing terms for all other uses
 or distribution of the Redistributables. jProductivity hereby reserves
 all right, title and interest in the Product and Redistributables not
 expressly granted under this License.</p>
<p><strong> 4. SPECIAL TERMS.</strong></p>
<p>The following terms and conditions ("Special Terms") are specific to
 certain editions, versions and components of the Product and are in
 addition to the provisions of Sections 2 and 3. If any provision of the
 Special Terms applicable to the Product conflicts with any other
 provision of this License, then the provision of the Special Terms will
 supersede and control.</p>
<p><strong> 4.1 ADDITIONAL LICENSE TERMS APPLICABLE TO PRODUCT LICENSED
 FOR EDUCATIONAL USE</strong></p>
<p>Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, you may
 exercise your rights under this license to use the Product and to
 create Works solely for your own personal use in providing or receiving
 instruction within the limited scope of guided computer programming
 and/or software training course(s) in which you are a direct and
 personal participant, either as student or instructor ("Course(s)").
 You may only reproduce, distribute and use Works, in source or object
 code form, to other participants of the Courses and then only for
 educational or training purposes. You may not use the Products or Works
 created with the Product for any commercial, business, governmental or
 institutional purpose of any kind, except to the extent you are an
 instructor teaching a Course. All rights not specifically granted to
 you herein are retained by jProductivity.</p>
<p><strong> 4.2 ADDITIONAL LICENSE TERMS APPLICABLE TO THIRD PARTY
 SOFTWARE</strong></p>
<p>Certain components of the Product use or incorporate third-party
 software programs and/or libraries ("Third-Party Software") which are
 loaded (in both object and source code form) on the Product media. You
 agree that jProductivity&#8217;s third-party licensors and suppliers are
 intended third party beneficiaries of all terms and conditions of this
 License intended to protect intellectual property rights in the Product
 (including the Third-Party Software) and limit certain uses thereof.</p>
<p><strong> 4.3 ADDITIONAL LICENSE TERMS APPLICABLE TO UPGRADES</strong></p>
<p>If you have acquired an upgrade version of the Product, such upgrade
 constitutes a single product together with the copy of the Product that
 you upgraded. This means that, although you may have two sets of
 Product media, you still have only one license. Therefore, you may not
 transfer the original copy of the Product to any other party.</p>
<p><strong> 4.4 ADDITIONAL LICENSE TERMS APPLICABLE TO TERM LICENSES</strong></p>
<p>If you have acquired a license for the Product that contains a
 limited term, for example an Evaluation License, the Product contains a
 time-out feature that disables its operation after the expiration of
 the term. Applications that you create during the term may require the
 Product in order to run. Upon expiration of the term, those
 applications may no longer run. You should therefore take precautions
 to avoid any loss of data that might result.</p>
<p> <strong>5. Limitations.</strong> You may not: (a) modify, adapt,
 alter, translate, or create derivative works of the Product or merge
 the Product with other software other than as described in the
 Product's accompanying documentation or as approved of in writing by
 jProductivity; (b) lease, rent or loan the Product to any third party;
 (c) sublicense, distribute or otherwise transfer the Product or any
 component thereof to any third party except as expressly authorized in
 this Agreement; (d) reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or
 otherwise attempt to derive the source code of the Product; (e) remove,
 alter, or obscure any confidentiality or proprietary notices (including
 copyright and trademark notices) of jProductivity or its licensors or
 suppliers on the Product; (f) allow third parties to access or use the
 Product including but not limited to in a time-sharing arrangement or
 operating the Product as part of a service bureau or, except as
 expressly authorized under Sections 2, 3 or 4, otherwise for the use or
 benefit of third parties; (g) reproduce or use the Product except as
 expressly authorized under Sections 2, 3 or 4; or (h) disclose or
 publish performance benchmark results for the Product. The rights
 granted under this License apply only to this Product. You must procure
 a separate license to use other jProductivity software. Furthermore,
 you may not permit your End Users to conduct the restricted activities
 limited by items (a) through (e), (g) and (h) above insofar as they
 apply to Redistributables, and such End User's sublicense rights to the
 Redistributables are conditioned upon compliance with such limitations.
 The limitations in this Section 5 apply equally to your use of the
 Product, in whole or in part, including any component or
 Redistributable.</p>
<p> <strong>6. LIMITED WARRANTY AND DISCLAIMER.</strong> jProductivity
 warrants to you, the original purchaser and to no other party, that any
 physical media included with the Product, as and when provided to you,
 will be free of physical defects in materials and workmanship for a
 period of ninety (90) days after the date that you initially acquire
 the Product. Your exclusive remedy and jProductivity &#8216;s sole liability
 for breach of this warranty is that jProductivity will replace any
 defective media returned to jProductivity within the ninety (90) day
 warranty period. This warranty does not apply to damages resulting from
 misuse, abuse or neglect. Any replacement media will be warranted as
 above for the remainder of the original warranty period or twenty (20)
 days from the date we ship it to you, whichever is longer. <strong>EXCEPT
 FOR THIS EXPRESS LIMITED WARRANTY, THE PRODUCT IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND
 WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. JPRODUCTIVITY HEREBY EXCLUDES AND
 DISCLAIMS ALL IMPLIED OR STATUTORY WARRANTIES, INCLUDING ANY WARRANTIES
 OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, QUALITY,
 NON-INFRINGEMENT, TITLE, RESULTS, EFFORTS OR QUIET ENJOYMENT. THERE IS
 NO WARRANTY THAT THE PRODUCT WILL BE ERROR-FREE OR WILL FUNCTION
 WITHOUT INTERRUPTION. YOU ASSUME THE ENTIRE RISK FOR THE RESULTS
 OBTAINED USING THE PRODUCT. TO THE EXTENT THAT JPRODUCTIVITY MAY NOT
 DISCLAIM ANY WARRANTY AS A MATTER OF APPLICABLE LAW, THE SCOPE AND
 DURATION OF SUCH WARRANTY WILL BE THE MINIMUM PERMITTED UNDER SUCH LAW.</strong></p>
<p><strong> SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED
 WARRANTIES, SO THE ABOVE EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. THIS LIMITED
 WARRANTY GIVES YOU SPECIFIC LEGAL RIGHTS, AND YOU MAY ALSO HAVE OTHER
 LEGAL RIGHTS, WHICH VARY FROM STATE TO STATE.</strong></p>
<p> <strong>7. SERVICES; UPDATES; PRODUCT CHANGES.</strong>
 jProductivity is not required under this License to provide any
 installation, training or other services to you. Such services, if
 available, must be purchased separately. If, pursuant to a separate
 support agreement or otherwise, jProductivity provides you with a new
 release, error correction, update, upgrade or other modification to the
 Product, such modification will be deemed part of the Product, and
 subject to the terms of this License, unless the modification is
 expressly provided subject to a separate license agreement.
 jProductivity reserves the right at any time not to release or to
 discontinue release of any Product and to alter prices, features,
 specifications, capabilities, functions, licensing terms, release
 dates, general availability or other characteristics of any future
 releases of the Product.</p>
<p> <strong>8. Confidentiality.</strong> You acknowledge that the
 Product in source code form remains a confidential trade secret of
 jProductivity. You agree to hold this information in confidence, not
 disclose it to any person, and not use it for any purpose other than
 the use and operation of the Product as permitted under this License.</p>
<p><strong> 9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. IN NO EVENT WILL JPRODUCTIVITY
 BE LIABLE TO ANY PARTY FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL,
 EXEMPLARY, SPECIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY LOSS OF PROFIT,
 REVENUE, BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY OR DATA, ARISING FROM OR RELATING TO THIS
 LICENSE OR THE PRODUCT, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, IN TORT, NEGLIGENCE OR
 OTHERWISE, EVEN IF JPRODUCTIVITY KNEW, SHOULD HAVE KNOWN OR HAS BEEN
 ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. JPRODUCTIVITY&#8217;S TOTAL
 CUMULATIVE LIABILITY ARISING FROM OR RELATED TO THIS LICENSE OR THE
 PRODUCT, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, IN TORT OR OTHERWISE, WILL NOT EXCEED THE
 FEES ACTUALLY PAID BY YOU UNDER THIS LICENSE. THIS SECTION 9 WILL
 APPLY EVEN IF AN EXCLUSIVE REMEDY HEREUNDER HAS FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL
 PURPOSE.</strong></p>
<p><strong> SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF
 INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION OR
 EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</strong></p>
<p><strong> 10. TERM AND TERMINATION.</strong></p>
<p> <strong>10.1 Term.</strong> The term of this License will begin as
 of the date that you receive the Product and will remain in effect

 notice is served to cure the breach described therein. If the breach is
 cured within the thirty (30) day grace period, then this License will
 remain in effect; otherwise, this License will automatically terminate
 upon the conclusion of the thirty (30) day grace period.</p>
<p> <strong>10.4 Effect of Termination.</strong> Upon the termination
 of this License for any reason the following terms shall apply: (a) all
 rights granted under this License will immediately terminate and you
 must stop all use of the Product and any Redistributables; (b) you must
 return to jProductivity or destroy all copies of the Product provided
 to or made by you, and will, within ten (10) days after the effective
 date of termination, provide jProductivity with written certification
 that all such copies have been returned or destroyed; and (c) all
 provisions of this License with the exception of the licenses granted
 in Sections 2, 3 and 4, will survive termination of this License for
 any reason.</p>
